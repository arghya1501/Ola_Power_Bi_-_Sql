# Ola Power BI & SQL Project

This repository contains the SQL queries and Power BI report used for analyzing Ola ride booking data. The project consists of the following key files:

- **Bookings.csv**: The dataset containing ride booking information.
- **ola quary.sql**: SQL scripts that perform various queries on the bookings data.
- **ola.pbix**: The Power BI report file used for data visualization.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Database Setup

Before running the queries, create and select the database with the following commands:

```sql
Create database ola;
use ola;
```

---

## SQL Queries

The SQL queries in this project are designed to extract insights from the `bookings` table. Below are the query snippets:

### 1. Retrieve all successful bookings

```sql
select Booking_ID, Booking_Status from bookings
where Booking_Status = "Success";

select count(Booking_ID) from bookings
where Booking_Status = "Success";
```

### 2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type

```sql
select Vehicle_Type, Round(avg(Ride_Distance), 2) as average_ride_distance from bookings
group by Vehicle_Type;
```

### 3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers

```sql
select count(Booking_Status) as cancelled_rides
from bookings
where Booking_Status = "Canceled by Customer";
```

### 4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides

```sql
select Customer_ID, count(Booking_ID) as highest_number_of_rides
from bookings
group by Customer_ID
order by highest_number_of_rides desc limit 5;
```

### 5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues

```sql
select count(Canceled_Rides_by_Driver) as cancelled_by_drivers
from bookings
where Canceled_Rides_by_Driver = "Personal & Car related issue";
```

### 6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings

```sql
Select max(Driver_Ratings) as Max_Driver_Rating, min(Driver_Ratings) as Min_Drive_Rating from bookings;
```

### 7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI

```sql
Select Booking_ID, Payment_Method from bookings
where Payment_Method = "UPI";
```

### 8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type

```sql
Select Vehicle_Type, round(avg(Customer_Rating), 2) as Avg_Rating from bookings
group by Vehicle_Type;
```

### 9. Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully

```sql
Select sum(Booking_Value) as total_Booking_Value from bookings
where Booking_Status = "Success";
```

### 10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason

```sql
Select Booking_ID, Incomplete_Rides_Reason from bookings
where Incomplete_Rides_Reason <> "Null";

Select count(Booking_ID) from bookings
where Incomplete_Rides_Reason <> "Null";
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Database & Data Import**:  
   - Create the `ola` database and switch to it.
   - Import the data from `Bookings.csv` into a table named `bookings`.

2. **Executing SQL Queries**:  
   - Run the SQL queries provided in the `ola quary.sql` file to extract various insights from the data.
